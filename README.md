# ATLAS-encoders

This is the repo that contains my response to the Evaluation exercise for Google Summer of Code / ATLAS autoencoders.

`main.ipynb` is the main jupyter notebook, while `google_colab.ipynb` contains the results of me playing around with some models.

Everything i have done, along with the plots i have plotted, are shown in this presentation i have made
